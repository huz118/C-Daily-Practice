# C-Daily-Practice
Using C++ to practice programming skills

The initial idea for setting up this repository on Github is to encourage myself to 
keep learning C++ programming. To be honest, C++ is not the first and most fluent langurage I used. 
But when you put yourself to Job searching market, you will find out that only programming with Matlab is 
far than enough. Somehow stupid. So I tell myself to be a expert of C++. This is the beginning.
